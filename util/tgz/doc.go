/*

Package tgz lets you work with gzip tar streams.

It defines interfaces for reading and writing tar streams, provides
a modular implementation of them and exports some high-level functions
for common tasks like recursively writing all the files in a directory
to a gzip tar archive stream, creating or extracting a tarball.
